# Project Stopped
I have recently found FOSS https://snipeitapp.com/ which is exactly the direction I was going and there's no reason to reinvent the wheel.

Keeping the repo for future code snippits

## Synopsis

A light weight all web client for asset (IT) management.
Simple server side nodejs doing CRUD to SQL. 

## Motivation

To much emphasis on whole software suite solutions for large scale operations. For smaller scale, these applications become a hinderance to configure and use.
At it's core, all data is stored in a database (SQL), and the client is a HTML5 modern browser. 

## Installation

Client: Any modern browser with basic ES6 capability. Tested client is Chrome v56

Server: NODEJS. Tested with v4.2.6

## Running

Server: cd server && npm install && nodejs server.js

Client: index.html
